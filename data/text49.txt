<COUNTRY role="main">Zambia</COUNTRY> bans hunting of lions and leopards

<COUNTRY>Zambia</COUNTRY> has banned the hunting of lions and leopards because of the rapid decline in its numbers of big cats.

<COUNTRY>Zambia</COUNTRY>'s tourism minister said there was more value in game-viewing tourism than blood sport, which brought in just $3m (Â£1.9m) last year.

Sylvia Masebo said the country did not have enough cats for hunting purposes.

"Tourists come to <COUNTRY>Zambia</COUNTRY> to see the lion and if we lose the lion we will be killing our tourism industry," she told Reuters.

While lions are found in all of <COUNTRY>Zambia</COUNTRY>'s major parks, their numbers are limited.

There are thought to be no more than about 4,500 lions in the whole country, while the leopard population is unknown.

Neighbouring <COUNTRY>Botswana</COUNTRY> is banning all sport hunting from 2014, while <COUNTRY>Kenya</COUNTRY> halted hunting for sport decades ago.
