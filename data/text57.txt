The $200m downfall of Elba Esther Gordillo, <COUNTRY role="main">Mexico</COUNTRY>'s Teacher

<COUNTRY>Mexico</COUNTRY> has arrested the leader of its powerful teachers' union on suspicion of embezzling $200 million and using it to pay for luxury homes in <CONTINENT>America</CONTINENT>, private planes, shopping sprees, works of art, and plastic surgery.

Elba Esther Gordillo, 68, known as "La Maestra," or The Teacher, is alleged to have funnelled union money to bank accounts in <COUNTRY>Switzerland</COUNTRY> and <COUNTRY>Liechtenstein</COUNTRY>, buying two homes in <CITY>San Diego</CITY>, spending $3 million at the luxury <COUNTRY>US</COUNTRY> department store Neiman Marcus, and undergoing at least $17,000 worth of cosmetic procedures.

A $1 million transfer to a Swiss account, for a company registered to Gordillo's mother, allegedly went towards a property on <LANDMARK>Coronado Island</LANDMARK> off <CITY>San Diego</CITY>, which one of the most affluent places in <CONTINENT>America</CONTINENT> to live. It is home to sports stars, politicians and actors, and former residents have included Wallis Simpson, the Duchess of Windsor.

Gordillo has been a towering and flamboyant figure in Mexican politics for two decades as head of the 1.5 million member National Union of Education Workers, the largest labour union in <REGION>Latin America</REGION>.

She also became a symbol of alleged corruption, living in a penthouse in <CITY>Mexico City</CITY>, wearing designer clothes and being ferried around in expensive cars with bodyguards. She was once photographed carrying a $5,500 purse and wearing $1,200 shoes, and has been accused of amassing 10 homes.

Her arrest came as the new President Enrique Pena Nieto sought to force through reform which would break the union's grip over the education system. The union controls appointments and the curriculum, and has allegedly been padding the public payroll with thousands of phantom teachers.

Gordillo was detained at an airport just outside <CITY>Mexico City</CITY> along with several other union officials after she arrived on a private plane from <CITY>San Diego</CITY>.

<COUNTRY>Mexico</COUNTRY>'s Attorney General Jesus Murillo said: "Clearly, we're facing a case in which the money of education workers has been misused illegally for the benefit of various people. Under this government nobody is above the law."

Gordillo was born into poverty in the south of <COUNTRY>Mexico</COUNTRY> and started working as a teacher at 15, before being widowed at 18.

She was formerly a prominent member of Pena Nieto's centrist Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) but was expelled in 2006.

She formed her own New Alliance Party and was considered key in securing a close victory for Felipe Calderon in the presidential election that year.

Murillo denied that the arrest was politically motivated, adding: "This was a very clear investigation and we will have more of them."

In a television interview last week Gordillo said: "There is no one more loved by their people than I. I care about the teachers."
