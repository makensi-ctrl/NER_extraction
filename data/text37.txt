Poachers kill 11 elephants in <COUNTRY role="main">Kenya</COUNTRY>

Poachers killed a family of 11 elephants in the biggest single mass shooting of the animals on record in <COUNTRY>Kenya</COUNTRY>, wildlife officials said today.

A gang of about 10 attackers hacked off the elephants' tusks in <LANDMARK>Tsavo East National Park</LANDMARK> on Saturday, officials said - the latest sign of a resurgence of mostly Asian demand for ivory jewellery and ornaments.

"(It) shows the great lengths these criminal cartels are ready to go to get ivory. It's really tragic," <COUNTRY>Kenya</COUNTRY> Wildlife Service spokesman Paul Udo told Reuters via Twitter.

He said it was the worst single incident of its kind recorded in the East African country. Elephant poaching in <COUNTRY>Kenya</COUNTRY> declined sharply after 1989 when the government banned trade in ivory.

But there has been a rise in the illegal practice in recent years. Demand for ornamental ivory is rising fast in <CONTINENT>Asia</CONTINENT> in tandem with growing Chinese influence and investment in <CONTINENT>Africa</CONTINENT>.

The <COUNTRY>Kenya</COUNTRY> Wildlife Service said foot, dog and aerial units were hunting the gang.

"The entire family of 11 elephants have been confirmed poached and tusks chopped off. All the carcasses had bullet wounds," the service said in a statement.

In May, 359 tusks weighing 1.6 tonnes impounded in <COUNTRY>Sri Lanka</COUNTRY> were found to have come from <COUNTRY>Kenya</COUNTRY>'s <CITY>Mombasa</CITY> port.

Police found 214 tusks worth $1.32 million hidden in a coffin and fertiliser bags in neighbouring <COUNTRY>Tanzania</COUNTRY> in October. The force said smugglers had planned to transport the ivory to <COUNTRY>Kenya</COUNTRY> for onward shipment to <CONTINENT>Asia</CONTINENT>.
