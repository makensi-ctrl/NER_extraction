Organisers of the Sydney Festival say they are more than ready for Day One, which kicks off at three sites around the city tomorrow.

Now in its 36th year, the Sydney Festival's first day will start with a 9:30am performance by artist 'Humphrey'.

He will be running a marathon on a treadmill in <POI>Hyde Park</POI>, accompanied by back up dancers, a pop music soundtrack and plenty of acrobatics.

After that the action will move to <POI>Darling Harbour</POI> for another family friendly event - the floating performance of the arrival, which will feature more than 100 actors and dancers as well as a five-storey high inflatable duck.

Then, in the evening, the traditional concert will be held at the Domain.

Festival Director Lieven Bertels says the Daptone Supersoul Revue will appeal to all ages.

"We will dance the night away and that will be the proper start," he said.

The three-week program showcases a range of Australian and international artists including a Francis Bacon retrospective at the Art gallery of <UNIT>New South Wales</UNIT> and a performance by singer Archie Roach.

There will also be plenty of festival fun to be had <CITY role="main">Sydney</CITY>'s west, with <UNIT>Parramatta</UNIT> hosting a series of events including a free opening night party on January 19.

The Sydney Festival will run until January 27.
