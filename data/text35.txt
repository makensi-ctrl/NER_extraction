<CITY>Cochin</CITY> history
It is not known exactly how the name <CITY>Kochi</CITY> originated. But many theories exist. Some historians believe that <CITY>Cochin</CITY> is a modified form of the word 'Cochazhi' which in Malayalam means 'small sea' 

Though <CITY>Cochin</CITY> had been an important roadstead in days gone by, it became a natural harbor only when nature decreed it so. <CITY>Muziris</CITY> (present-day <REGION>Kodungalloor</REGION> on the mouth of the <LANDMARK>Periyar River</LANDMARK>), 40 km north of <CITY>Cochin</CITY>, was the center of trade with ancient <CITY>Rome</CITY> in the products like pepper and pearls, fine silks, cotton, muslin, honey, oil, betel, tortoise shell, cinnamon leaf, black pepper, ginger grass, and indigo. For centuries, <CITY>Cochin</CITY> was the battleground of European powers for the mastery of the lucrative trade of the Indian west coast. 

The fortunes of political powers in <CITY>Cochin</CITY> were dictated by pepper. The Portuguese were the first to come in. Two years later, the adventurous mariner, the legendary Vasco da Gama himself landed in <CITY>Cochin</CITY>. The Portuguese erected a fort for the protection of their factory. <POI>Fort Manuel</POI>, or <POI>Manuel Kotta</POI>, named after the King of Portugal, was the first fortress constructed by the Europeans in <COUNTRY>India</COUNTRY>. 

To the Portuguese must go the credit for the extensive scientific cultivation of coconut, ginger, and pepper, backbone of <UNIT>Kerala</UNIT>'s economy today. Tobacco, cashew nut, and fruit cultivation were also introduced. The pineapple, for instance, is still called prithichakka in Malayalam, meaning Portuguese jackfruit. They were also responsible for today's burgeoning trade in coir. 

The Dutch, full of energy and zeal, were next to enter the scene and succeeded in throwing out the Portuguese very soon. Helped by a laissez-faire policy and a self-stipulated dictum of "at least a 100% profit," <CITY>Cochin</CITY> saw a great resurgence of trade.
